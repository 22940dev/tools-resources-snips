# [My Extended Brain ðŸŒ¿](https://epictools.dev/)

This is currently an extension of [my wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz). A place where I keep snippets of code/notes/config. As well as a place for deep thinking and connecting knowledge in meaningful ways. All done with a goal to create a digital version of my brain that I can seamlessly query and gain insight from.

It's using [Dendron](https://dendron.so) to make that happen.

This wiki is inspired greatly by [Andy](https://andymatuschak.org/) and the [many wikis others have shared](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/other/wiki-workflow#similar-wikis-i-liked).

The space of digital gardens is [still small](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) and the tools are getting better. [Dendron](https://dendron.so), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com), [RemNote](https://www.remnote.io), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com)..

Gardens unlike blogs don't go stale and are easier to keep vibrant and grow organically. Take a look around and I hope I can inspire you to make your own [digital garden, where you share what you know](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/#grow-your-own-digital-garden). I'd love to read it. ðŸŒ±

The source of this garden is on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/epictools.dev).

You can access everything here using search above or [Alfred My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind).

This wiki was initially made with GitBook, a version of which you can find [here](https://code.nikitavoloboev.xyz). It will be removed as soon as Dendron search gets better. ðŸ˜Š
