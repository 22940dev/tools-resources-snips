# [My Extended Brain](https://epictools.dev/)

This is currently an extension of [my wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz). A place where I keep snippets of code/notes/config together with more extended place for thinking and connecting knowledge. It's using [Dendron](https://dendron.so) to make that happen.

I am working on Dendron tool to make it better for everyone, so this is a place where I will keep many experiments for how to do better note taking. Drawing inspiration from the [many wikis other uses haved shared](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/other/wiki-workflow#similar-wikis-i-liked) and other tools such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com), [RemNote](https://www.remnote.io) and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com).

The source of this garden is on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/epictools.dev).

You can access everything here using search above or [Alfred My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind).

If you like this, I'd love to see your own [digital garden, where you share what you know](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/#grow-your-own-digital-garden).
